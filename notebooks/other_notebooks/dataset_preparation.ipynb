He waits until he is sure both have had time to get home from their jobs, and then detonates the device by remote control, totally demolishing the house.

Hazel approaches the couple, pulls out a gun, and tells them to hand over all of their money and valuables. The couple was having an unusually bad day: they had just been mugged five minutes before and were on their way to notify the police when Hazel approached them. Consequently, they had no money or valuables. Hazel is charged with attempted robbery.\\nD.
